# MSC-DOLES
MSC-DOLES: Multi-view Subspace Clustering in Diverse Orthogonal Latent Embedding Spaces

The DOLES.m file is the main function of our method, the demo.m file is an instance of our method, and the time.m file is the time comparison chart of the baseline we selected.

Run "demo.m" to test the MSC-DOLES algorithm. The code has been tested in Matlab R2022b on a PC with Windows 10.
